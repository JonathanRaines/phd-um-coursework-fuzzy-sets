	abstract = {A mathematical tool to build a fuzzy model of a system where reasoning is given by the aggregation of the values inferred fuzzy implications and reasoning are used is presented in this paper. The premise of an implication is the description of fuzzy subspace of inputs and its consequence is a linear input-output relation. The method of identification of a system using its input-output data is then shown. Two applications of the method to industrial processes are also discussed: a water cleaning process and a converter in a steel-making process.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy logic control, due to its simple control structure, easy and cost-effective design, has been successfully employed to the application of guidance and control in robotic fields. This paper aims to review fuzzy-logic-based guidance and control in an important branch of robots—marine robotic vehicles. First, guidance and motion forms including the maneuvering, path following, trajectory tracking, and position stabilization are described. Subsequently, the application of three major classes of fuzzy logic control, including the conventional fuzzy control (Mamdani fuzzy control and Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy control), adaptive fuzzy control (self-tuning fuzzy control and direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control), and hybrid fuzzy control (fuzzy PID control, fuzzy sliding mode control, and neuro-fuzzy control) are presented. In particular, we summarize the design and analysis process of direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control and fuzzy PID control in marine robotic fields. In addition, two comparative results between hybrid fuzzy control and the corresponding single control are provided to illustrate the superiority of hybrid fuzzy control. Finally, trends of the fuzzy future in marine robotic vehicles are concluded based on its state of the art.},

	abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operate in unknown underwater environments and must be able to avoid submerged obstacles such as cliffs, wrecks, and seabed changes. This paper proposes a methodology for obstacle avoidance by AUVs that are equipped with forward-looking sonars (FLSs). The data collected from two FLSs placed in horizontal and vertical orientation are processed in real time to provide obstacle detection information in the xz- and xy-planes, respectively. Due to the necessity of maintaining constant height when employing sidescan sonar (SSS) and lower energy consumption, horizontal avoidance maneuvers are preferred over vertical ones. For the horizontal obstacle avoidance, a two-layer obstacle avoidance algorithm (OAA) contains two different processes, an OAA based on Bandler and Kohout (BK) product of fuzzy relation used as a preplanning method and a reactive approach based on potential ﬁeld and edge detection methods. The preplanning technique has a clear advantage on a line segment of the path, and the reactive method is more efﬁcient on a curved segment. In case a horizontal approach cannot ﬁnd a path to safely avoid the obstacle, the reactive vertical approach is activated. A seabed gradient detection technique that allows prediction of seabed and altitude changes up to 40 m ahead of the AUV is presented. Simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed methodology enables AUVs to navigate safely through obstacles and provide crucial information about the seaﬂoor terrain changes.},
